"Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!\nLet the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.\nAnd, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or never more!\nSee! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!\nCome! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--\nAn anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--\nA dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young.\n\n\"Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,\nAnd when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!\nHow _shall_ the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung\nBy you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue\nThat did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?\"\n\n_Peccavimus;_ but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song\nGo up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!\nThe sweet Lenore hath \"gone before,\" with Hope, that flew beside,\nLeaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--\nFor her, the fair and _d\u00e9bonnaire_, that now so lowly lies,\nThe life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--\nThe life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.\n\n\"Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,\nBut waft the angel on her flight with a p\u00e6an of old days!\nLet _no_ bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,\nShould catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned Earth.\nTo friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--\nFrom Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven--\nFrom grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven.\""
